# ✅ Machine Learning Roadmap Checklist

## 🐍 Python Refresher
- [x] Data types, control flow, functions
- [x] List comprehensions and generator expressions
- [x] Classes, dunder methods, encapsulation
- [x] Decorators and `@property`
- [ ] Modules, imports, and packaging
- [x] Jupyter Notebook workflow and Markdown documentation

## 📊 Data Foundations
- [ ] NumPy arrays and broadcasting
- [ ] pandas DataFrames: indexing, filtering, grouping
- [ ] Data cleaning: missing values, outliers, type conversion
- [ ] Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): summary stats, distributions
- [ ] Data visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

## 🧠 Core ML Concepts
- [ ] Supervised vs unsupervised learning
- [ ] Train/test split, cross-validation
- [ ] Bias-variance tradeoff
- [ ] Feature scaling and normalization
- [ ] One-hot encoding and categorical variables

## 📦 Essential Models
- [ ] Linear regression and logistic regression
- [ ] Decision trees and random forests
- [ ] K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
- [ ] Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- [ ] Naive Bayes
- [ ] K-means clustering and DBSCAN

## 🧪 Model Evaluation
- [ ] Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score
- [ ] Confusion matrix and ROC curves
- [ ] Cross-validation and grid search
- [ ] Overfitting and regularization (L1, L2)
